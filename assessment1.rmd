# RMarkdown editing

**R Markdown** is a file format for making dynamic documents with R. An **R Markdown** document is written in markdown (*an easy-to-write plain text format*) and contains chunks of embedded R code, like the document below.

This [LINK](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-8.html) provides information on RMarkdown basics.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(skimr)

fastfood <- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2018/2018-09-04/fastfood_calories.csv')

fastfood%>%head(10)

knitr::kable(fastfood[1:10,1:5])


```
